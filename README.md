Human detection on Aerial video

As the unstructured data exponentially increasing, it was important to gain useful insight from these data. Now a days lot of dat will be availble in pictorictal and in video format. Due to availability of high processing RAM (GPU) it is possible to extract information these unstructured data. Object detection is one of the important method to extract the informaton from these data. 
We used faster R-CNN to trained our model for human detection on Aerial video (usually drone captured video) using tensorflow API. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

In this code we used opencv library to read, process and save video. Trained video will be automicaly saved on defined location. 
No need to seperately definr the resolution of video, Code automically read the frame shape, height, width of the input video.
